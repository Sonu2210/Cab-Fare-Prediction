Project Overview
Imagine you're launching a cab service that’s ready to hit the national stage. After a successful pilot run, you've gathered valuable historical data.
Now, it’s time to harness that data to predict cab fares with precision. This project aims to build a system that uses advanced analytics to forecast the cost of a cab ride in the city, based on factors like pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, and passenger count.



Objective
Design a predictive model to estimate the fare amount for a cab ride using historical data collected from the pilot project. 
The goal is to create a robust system that can accurately predict fares based on input features such as pickup and drop-off coordinates, timestamp, and passenger count.

Dataset
The project uses both training and test datasets provided in the repository. The datasets contain the following attributes:
  - pickup_datetime: Timestamp value indicating when the cab ride started.
  - pickup_longitude: Float value for the longitude coordinate where the cab ride started.
  - pickup_latitude: Float value for the latitude coordinate where the cab ride started.
  - dropoff_longitude: Float value for the longitude coordinate where the cab ride ended.
  - dropoff_latitude: Float value for the latitude coordinate where the cab ride ended.
  - passenger_count: Integer indicating the number of passengers in the cab ride.

Project Workflow

  - Import Required Libraries
  - Set Up the Environment
  - Load the Data: Load the training and test datasets from the repository.
  - Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
      - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and identify anomalies.
      - Handle missing values, outliers, and convert timestamps to relevant features.
  - Feature Engineering:
      - Split pickup_datetime into relevant features like year, month, day, hour, etc.
      - Calculate the distance between pickup and drop-off coordinates.
  - Model Training and Evaluation:
      - Split the data into training and testing sets.
      - Train different regression models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression.
      - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
  - Hyperparameter Tuning:
      - Use GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the models.
  - Prediction and Submission:
      - Predict fare amounts using the test dataset.
      - Save predictions and prepare them for submission.
